# UniqueElement
Given an array of 2N+1 elements, N elements occur twice in the array. Find the element that occurs in the array only once.

This implements the requested function GetUniqueElement() that utilizes a Dictionary to complete the task. It also implements another one, GetUniqueElementBySort(), that uses a sorted array and compares adjacent values. Their time efficiency is tested and displayed.
